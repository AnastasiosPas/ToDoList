Hi there,

this is a little fun web app that I made for practice while studying the Zero-to-Mastery course.
It is actually easy to use and it can be quite handy.\

You may at first click-delete all template tasks and fill yours, one by one. When you finish a task, just click on it and it will be striked-through! If you don't even need it there, just delete it,
and so on :)

Thanks for checking it!
